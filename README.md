Credit card services is one of major forms of payment in the retail industry today. In a competitive market and many different forms of payments on the rise, customer attrition is one of the problems banks are facing. In this project Our group chose this topic to improve customer churn rate by analyzing a dataset from a bank by identifying existing customers who are likely to churn or drop off.

Our group uses Zoom and Slack as our main way of communicating. On top of our class meetings, we have decided to meet outside class hours via Zoom. Each time we upload or make modification to our project, we notify group members through Slack. In the same way, comments and suggestions are also sent via Slack.
