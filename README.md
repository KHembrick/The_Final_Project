## Problem Statement & Goal
A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate if we could predict for them who is gonna get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction.Customer Churn (customer attrition) is the most challenging problem for Banks. Our group has analyzed the customer demographic trends and retrieved all relevant data using SQL (Structured Query Language). A Supervised Machinge Learning Algorithm was developed using the Logistic Regression Oversampling Model that predicts the customers who are likely to churn from the existing customers.
