## Details about the Raw Data

The Raw dataset consist of 10,000 customers that includes their age, education level, martial status and income etc. There are nearly 18 features.

## How are we going to Predict Customers who are likely to churn?

We have taken the raw data and cleaned and checked for any duplicates and any unnecessary coloums. Next we used SQL and created a Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) as shown in the image below.

The next step is to take our cleaned data and import it into python to build a supervised machine learning model. Below is a snippet of the Exploratory Data Analysis code and the ouput in the client info section.

Our group uses Zoom and Slack as our main way of communicating. On top of our class meetings, we have decided to meet outside class hours via Zoom. Each time we upload or make modification to our project, we notify group members through Slack. In the same way, comments and suggestions are sent via Slack.
